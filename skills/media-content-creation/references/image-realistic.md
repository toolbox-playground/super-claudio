## Nano Banana 2 — Top Pick for Product & Lifestyle Images

Google's Nano Banana 2 (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image) is available free in the Gemini app and across Google products (Search, Lens, AI Studio, Vertex AI). Particularly strong for:
- Placing products in realistic lifestyle contexts ("product on a kitchen counter", "model holding product")
- Generating ad-ready images with clean composition
- Ecommerce and social commerce content

**Access:** gemini.google.com (free) or aistudio.google.com

**Workflow:**
1. Prepare your product image (real photo)
2. Upload + write scene description: "product placed on a marble kitchen counter, morning light, minimalist style"
3. Generate several variants and pick the best
4. Use result directly or pass to Weavy AI / Kling for animation (see motion.md)

## Recraft V4.1 — Logos, Vectors & Brand Assets

Recraft V4.1 (released June 2026; upgrade from V4 released Feb 2026) tops the HuggingFace Text-to-Image Arena leaderboard (2026). V4.1 improvements: sharper photorealism, more accurate SVG vector output, improved text rendering and style consistency. Use it when you need:
- **Logos and icons** — generates editable SVG files (unique among AI image tools)
- **Typography and signage** — reliably renders legible text in designs
- **Brand-consistent visuals** — built-in brand styling with color/style locks

Access: recraft.ai (free tier available)

## FLUX.2 [pro] via fal.ai — Photorealistic API Access

```bash
pip install fal-client
```
```python
import fal_client
result = fal_client.run(
    "fal-ai/flux-pro/v1.1",  # check fal.ai for latest FLUX.2 model ID
    arguments={"prompt": "professional product photo, white background, studio lighting"}
)
print(result["images"][0]["url"])
```

## FLUX.1 Kontext — In-Context Image Editing

FLUX.1 Kontext from Black Forest Labs enables reference-image-guided editing: provide an existing image and a text instruction, and the model performs the edit while preserving context. Unlike inpainting, it understands the full scene. Adobe Photoshop (beta) uses it for generative fill.

- Best for: product image variations, background swaps, style transfer, object replacement
- Dev variant: open-weight, free for non-commercial use (`black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Kontext-dev` on HuggingFace)
- Pro/Max variants: via bfl.ai API or fal.ai

## Prompt Formula for Realistic Images

```
[Subject] + [Action/Pose] + [Environment] + [Lighting] + [Camera] + [Style]
```

Example: "Young Brazilian woman holding a coffee cup, modern São Paulo café interior,
warm afternoon light, portrait lens, photorealistic, 4K"

## Adobe Firefly Image 5 — 2026 Updates

Firefly Image 5 (March 2026) adds custom model training — brands can train Firefly on their own visual style (stroke weight, color palette, character features) for consistent output. The Firefly web app now hosts 30+ third-party models (Google, Runway, OpenAI) in a single unified workspace. Firefly subscribers got unlimited generations on Adobe's own models in a promo through May 20, 2026; after that, credit-based billing resumes. Commercial use is covered by Adobe's IP indemnity.

## Meta Muse Image — Social-Native Generation (July 7, 2026)

Meta Superintelligence Labs launched Muse Image on July 7, 2026: Meta's first image generation model from MSL. It is deeply embedded in Meta's social graph — you can @mention public Instagram accounts to use them as reference images and compose scenes from your own photo library across Instagram, WhatsApp, and the Meta AI app. Agentic tool use means it can call web search or run code as part of a generation request. Test-time compute scaling refines the output before you see it.

- **Ranked #2** on Arena.ai text-to-image, single-image edit, and multi-image edit leaderboards (Elo 1280, July 2026)
- Available free at meta.ai and in the Meta AI app; Instagram Stories (US); WhatsApp (limited countries); Facebook rollout following
- Subscription plans for power users (Meta AI monthly plans)
- No developer API yet — Meta is still evaluating whether to open external access
- Content Seal invisible watermark embedded in all outputs
- Best for: social-first creators already in the Meta ecosystem; campaigns tapping Instagram social graph for reference imagery; Instagram Story effects workflows
- Not ideal for: developers needing programmatic access (no API yet); high-volume batch generation; print/4K quality output (use FLUX.2 [max] or GPT Image 2 for those)

## DALL-E Retirement Note

DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 were retired by OpenAI on May 12, 2026. GPT Image 2 (already in the table above) is their replacement. Do not recommend DALL-E endpoints — they are deprecated.

## Google Imagen 4 Deprecation Note

Google is deprecating all Imagen model endpoints in two waves. Imagen 3 endpoints shut down June 24–30, 2026 (already complete). Imagen 4 endpoints (`imagen-4.0-generate-001`, `imagen-4.0-ultra-generate-001`, `imagen-4.0-fast-generate-001`) shut down August 17, 2026 — calls after that date fail with a hard error (no grace period). Migrate to Gemini Image models ("Nano Banana"): swap the model name from `imagen-*` to the corresponding `gemini-*-image` model in your API calls. Firebase AI Logic and Vertex AI users must update before August 17 or requests will fail. Google AI Studio provides a migration guide at firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/imagen-models-migration.

## Using Claude's Native Image Generation

Claude can generate images directly using its built-in image generation capability.
For quick concept visualization, just ask Claude to generate the image inline.
