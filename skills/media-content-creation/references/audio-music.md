## Suno — Text-to-Music

Generate complete songs (vocals + instruments) from a text prompt.

- URL: suno.com
- **Latest model: v6 (v6, v6-wild, v6-mini) — launched Sept 9, 2026.** Built with licensed catalogs from Warner Music Group, BMG, and Believe (Believe deal announced Sept 8, 2026); v6 and v6-wild require Pro/Premier, v6-mini is available free. **The old v5.5-and-earlier unlicensed models were retired the same day** — this resolves the "pending retirement" situation from earlier in 2026 (see note below).
- **Suno Studio (in-browser DAW):** Multi-track view, stem separation (see below), 6-band EQ, Warp Markers (adjust timing post-generation), Remove FX (strip reverb/effects), alternates, and expanded time signature support. Available to Pro/Premier subscribers.
- **Stem Separation:** Three modes — **Advanced Split** (Premier only): choose from ~100 instruments to regenerate each stem from scratch — no separation artifacts; also exports MIDI; 10 credits/extracted track. **Split from Mix**: pull any instrument or voice out of the mix, get 2 stems; 10 credits/extraction. **Auto Split**: classic mode, splits into 12 stem categories; 50 credits.
- Free tier: v6-mini, 50 credits/day (~10 songs); non-commercial use only
- **Important (2026):** Free-tier users can no longer download audio files — tracks can only be streamed/shared within the platform. Download requires a paid plan ($10/month Pro, $30/month Premier).
- **Model retirement — completed Sept 9, 2026:** Following the November 2025 Warner Music Group settlement, Suno committed to retiring all models trained on unlicensed audio once new licensed-catalog models launched. That transition happened with the v6 launch — v5.5 and earlier are now retired; generations made with the old models remain accessible in your library but the models themselves can no longer generate new output. UMG and Sony Music litigation status was unresolved as of the last verified check (mid-2026) — verify current status if licensing terms matter for your use case.
- Input: genre, mood, lyrics (optional), style description
- Output: full song (streaming on free; downloadable MP3 on paid)

Example prompt: "upbeat Brazilian funk, energetic, no lyrics, good for TikTok ads"

## Udio — High-Quality Music Generation

Similar to Suno, strong on musicality and production quality.

- URL: udio.com
- **Important (2026):** Udio temporarily disabled all downloads (audio, video, stems) across all plan tiers during a 2025–2026 licensing transition. Tracks can only be streamed/shared on-platform as of May 2026 — no DAW export, no Spotify upload, no use in video.
- **Licensing deals signed:** Udio reached agreements with Universal Music Group (Oct 2025), Warner Music, Merlin, and Kobalt (Q1 2026). The new licensed platform launched Q2 2026 but operates as a **walled garden** — tracks cannot be downloaded or exported, only streamed/shared within the Udio network. No download capability is expected for the foreseeable future.
- Good for: previewing and sharing music concepts within the platform only; not suitable if you need to use the audio outside Udio

## Mureka v9.5 — Developer-Focused AI Music Generation

Mureka v9.5 (current default, up from v8) is the go-to for developers and technical producers: native API, stem separation, and MIDI export alongside full song generation. An **O3 model** (test-time scaling for improved song coherence) is in preview — check platform.mureka.ai for availability.

- URL: mureka.ai | API: platform.mureka.ai
- Free tier: available with limitations — non-commercial only, Mureka retains output rights on free
- Paid: $10/month (400 songs, full commercial rights); $30/month Pro
- Best for: API integration into apps, stem exports for remixing, developers who need programmatic music in their pipeline
- Commercial rights: full ownership on paid plans (royalty-free, use in ads/videos/streaming)


## ElevenLabs Music v2 — Genre-Switching AI Music with API Access (May 2026)

ElevenLabs launched ElevenMusic as an iOS app on April 1, 2026, then shipped Music v2 on May 26, 2026 — a major upgrade adding mid-track genre switching, chunk-based composition plans, and full API access across ElevenMusic, ElevenCreative, and ElevenAPI.

- URL: elevenlabs.io (ElevenMusic iOS, ElevenCreative web app, ElevenAPI)
- **API model_id:** `music_v2` (on Generate music, Stream music, Generate music detailed, Upload music endpoints)
- Free tier: up to 7 songs/day in ElevenMusic app (personal use only; no commercial rights on free)
- Commercial use: Starter plan+ (Music v2 trained on licensed data — cleared for commercial use on paid plans)
- Input: natural language text prompt; control lyrics on/off, song length, writing style, genre
- **Genre-switching mid-track:** one generation can shift between wildly different styles (operatic intro → metal breakdown → ambient outro)
- **Chunk-based composition:** build tracks section by section using GenerationChunk and AudioRefChunk objects — intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro — each preserving tonal continuity across the full track
- **Inpainting:** rebuild specific sections (e.g., only the bridge) without touching the rest of the song
- Better multilingual lyrics and arrangement vs Music v1
- Best for: developers integrating music generation via API (ElevenAPI); ad music and branded content (ElevenCreative); quick casual generation (ElevenMusic iOS app)

## MiniMax Music 3.0 — Structural Control + Open Weights

MiniMax Music 3.0 (up from 2.5) keeps the paragraph-level precision control over song structure and the improved spectral separation between vocals/instrumentation, and is now **open-weight/self-hostable** — a notable shift from the closed 2.5 release.

- URL: minimax.io/audio | API: wavespeed.ai/models/minimax/music-3
- Free tier: limited via minimax.io; API via WaveSpeedAI (pay-as-you-go); open weights available for self-hosting
- **14+ structural tags:** `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Interlude]`, `[Build-up]`, `[Hook]`, `[Outro]` — placed inline in the prompt to control song layout section by section
- **Audio fidelity:** Optimized soundstage keeps vocals and instruments in separate spectral regions — the key improvement over Music 2.0
- Best for: generation where song structure matters (commercial jingles, video scoring with section-to-cut sync, multi-verse songs with distinct parts)
- Not ideal for: stem export or MIDI (use Mureka v9.5); on-demand free generation (use Suno free tier)

## Google Flow Music (formerly Producer.ai / Riffusion) — Google-Owned, Free, Lyria 3 Powered

Riffusion rebranded to Producer.ai in July 2025. Google acquired Producer.ai in February 2026 and moved the team into Google Labs and Google DeepMind. On April 20, 2026, Google rebranded the tool again to **Google Flow Music**, integrating it into the broader Google Flow ecosystem alongside the video and image tools. Available free at flowmusic.app.

- URL: flowmusic.app (old URL producer.ai redirects here)
- Free tier: daily credit top-up; globally available (250+ countries), no waitlist
- Input: text prompt; also supports image-to-music and audio-to-music inputs; new Replace and Extend features for remixing specific sections of a track
- Stack: Lyria 3 (audio) + Veo (music video) + Nano Banana (album art) — all Google AI models
- Best for: free music generation with optional music video output; users in the Google/Gemini ecosystem

## Beatoven.ai — Fairly Trained Royalty-Free Music for Video

Beatoven.ai generates mood-based background music from text descriptions, purpose-built for video content creators. All training data is licensed from real musicians (Fairly Trained certified) — tracks carry a clean commercial license with verifiable IP provenance.

## Free Royalty-Free Music (no generation needed)

For background music without AI generation:
- **Pixabay Music** — pixabay.com/music — free, no attribution required
- **Free Music Archive** — freemusicarchive.org
- **YouTube Audio Library** — studio.youtube.com/channel/music
- **ccMixter** — ccmixter.org — Creative Commons licensed

## When to Use AI vs. Library

| Use AI music (Suno / Mureka) | Use library |
|---|---|
| Need specific mood/genre | Need something quickly |
| No matching library track | Any genre fits |
| Unique branded sound | Speed matters |
| Need API / stems / MIDI (Mureka) | Budget is zero |

> **Note:** As of June 2026, Udio's licensed platform has launched but operates as a walled garden — audio cannot be downloaded or exported. For any use case where you need to keep or use the generated audio, use Suno (paid), ElevenLabs Music v2 (free for personal; Starter plan+ for commercial), Google Flow Music / flowmusic.app (free, Google), or a royalty-free library instead.
