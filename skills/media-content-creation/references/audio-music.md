## Suno — Text-to-Music

Generate complete songs (vocals + instruments) from a text prompt.

- URL: suno.com
- **Latest model:** v5.5 (March 2026) — Voices (clone your singing voice), Custom Models (tune on your catalog), My Taste (personalized generation); v5.5 requires Pro/Premier; free tier capped at v4.5 and below
- **Suno Studio (in-browser DAW):** Multi-track view, stem separation (up to 12 stems, export as time-aligned WAV), 6-band EQ, Warp Markers (adjust timing post-generation), Remove FX (strip reverb/effects), alternates, and expanded time signature support. Studio 1.2 (February 2026) added warp markers, remove FX, and alternates. Available to Pro/Premier subscribers.
- Free tier: 50 credits/day (~10 songs); non-commercial use only
- **Important (2026):** Free-tier users can no longer download audio files — tracks can only be streamed/shared within the platform. Download requires a paid plan ($10/month Pro, $30/month Premier).
- Input: genre, mood, lyrics (optional), style description
- Output: full song (streaming on free; downloadable MP3 on paid)

Example prompt: "upbeat Brazilian funk, energetic, no lyrics, good for TikTok ads"

## Udio — High-Quality Music Generation

Similar to Suno, strong on musicality and production quality.

- URL: udio.com
- **Important (2026):** Udio temporarily disabled all downloads (audio, video, stems) across all plan tiers during a 2025–2026 licensing transition. Tracks can only be streamed/shared on-platform as of May 2026 — no DAW export, no Spotify upload, no use in video.
- **Licensing deals signed:** Udio reached agreements with Universal Music Group (Oct 2025), Warner Music, Merlin, and Kobalt (Q1 2026). A jointly licensed UMG × Udio platform is scheduled for 2026; downloads may return once the platform launches.
- Good for: previewing and sharing music concepts; not suitable if you need to use the audio outside Udio today

## Mureka v8 — Developer-Focused AI Music Generation

Mureka v8 is the go-to for developers and technical producers: native API, stem separation, and MIDI export alongside full song generation.

- URL: mureka.ai | API: platform.mureka.ai
- Free tier: available with limitations — non-commercial only, Mureka retains output rights on free
- Paid: $10/month (400 songs, full commercial rights); $30/month Pro
- Best for: API integration into apps, stem exports for remixing, developers who need programmatic music in their pipeline
- Commercial rights: full ownership on paid plans (royalty-free, use in ads/videos/streaming)

## Free Royalty-Free Music (no generation needed)

For background music without AI generation:
- **Pixabay Music** — pixabay.com/music — free, no attribution required

- **ccMixter** — ccmixter.org — Creative Commons licensed

## When to Use AI vs. Library

| Use AI music (Suno / Mureka) | Use library |
|---|---|
| Need specific mood/genre | Need something quickly |
| No matching library track | Any genre fits |
| Unique branded sound | Speed matters |
| Need API / stems / MIDI (Mureka) | Budget is zero |

> **Note:** As of May 2026, Udio still does not allow audio export (licensing transition in progress). For any use case where you need to keep or use the generated audio, use Suno (paid), ElevenLabs Music (free), Google Flow Music / flowmusic.app (free, Google), or a royalty-free library instead.
